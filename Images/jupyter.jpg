# FinancialPlanningTool

## Description

The Financial Planning notebook is a sample notebook that illustrates how to create two financial analysis tools with the following goals in mind:

1. A financial planner for emergencies. Members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

2. A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of a member's retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.

## Technologies

This example uses the following technologies:

- **Jupyter** - Jupyter is a web-based interactive development environment for data science and analysis. Please see [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.org/) for more information.
- **pandas** - pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. Please see [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for more information.
- **json** - `json` is library that provides APIs for interacting with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects.
- **requests** - `requests` is a library that provides APIs for HTTP, including making requests and handling responses.
- **Alcpaca**
